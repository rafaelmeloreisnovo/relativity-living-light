# Infinity / Cosmology Gap Implementation Index — 2026-07-17

**Branch:** `agent/scientific-infinity-gap-audit-20260717`  
**Base:** `main` at `80ebc8a46e22c066706381de7a7e15098b611cf9`  
**Claim state:** `claim_allowed=false` for physical infinity and new-cosmology claims.

## 1. Purpose

This index closes the implementation cycle that began with the symbolic compression of infinity and the proposed list of missing RLL cosmology layers.

Two distinct products were created:

1. a machine-enforced protocol for finite scientific execution over open-ended horizons;
2. a corrected audit distinguishing already-implemented statistical capabilities from genuinely missing physical layers.

## 2. Canonical reading order

1. `docs/science/RLL_INFINITY_OPEN_EVOLUTION_PROTOCOL.md`  
   Scientific vocabulary, seven operational axes, finite budgets, cycle detection, convergence and `TOKEN_VAZIO`.

2. `docs/science/RLL_COSMOLOGY_GAP_AUDIT_20260717.md`  
   Line-by-line correction of the submitted gap list and P0–P3 execution order.

3. `docs/canonicos/19_ROADMAP_FALSIFICADORES_RLL.md`  
   Canonical roadmap synchronized so closed tasks are no longer described as absent.

4. `src/rll/scientific_infinity.py`  
   Executable implementation of typed infinities, finite guards, evolution scoring and deterministic state hashing.

5. `schemas/scientific_infinity_cycle.schema.json`  
   Draft 2020-12 artifact contract requiring `finite_budgeted` execution and `claim_allowed=false`.

6. `schemas/examples/scientific_infinity_cycle.example.json`  
   Claim-bounded fixture preserving `TOKEN_VAZIO`.

7. `scripts/validate_scientific_infinity_cycle.py` and `tests/test_scientific_infinity.py`  
   Semantic validation and regression tests.

## 4. Verification performed before repository write

Local isolated verification of the new layer:

```text
python -m pytest -q tests/test_scientific_infinity.py tests/test_scientific_infinity_cycle_schema.py
12 passed

python scripts/validate_scientific_infinity_cycle.py
OK: scientific infinity cycle is finite, structurally valid and claim-bounded
```

The committed test file consolidates the code and schema cases into `tests/test_scientific_infinity.py`. GitHub Actions is configured to run the validator and test on relevant path changes.

## 5. Corrected state of the submitted gap list

### Already implemented or closed

- joint likelihood routes;
- DESI covariance support, including a committed full matrix in one route;
- MCMC with `emcee`;
- nested sampling / Bayes factor with `dynesty`;
- BBN baryon-density prior;
- compressed CMB distance priors;
- partial linear growth and `S8/fσ8` utilities.

### Still partial

- one canonical posterior route combining the strongest covariance/data implementations;
- full Pantheon+ STAT+SYS covariance in that sampler;
- robust chain convergence and prior sensitivity;
- CLASS/CAMB benchmark parity;
- formal H0 and S8 tension likelihoods.

### Still missing as executable physical closure

- covariant action or stress-energy derivation for the RLL sector;
- complete perturbation equations, stability and sound-speed prescription;
- CMB TT/TE/EE/lensing spectra;
- nonlinear structure/N-body implementation;
- primordial-spectrum/inflation mechanism;
- BBN abundance calculation;
- particle-level dark-sector interpretation.

## 6. Decision boundary

The infinity guard may conclude:

```text
continue | converged | cycle_detected | budget_exhausted | TOKEN_VAZIO
```

It may not conclude:

```text
physical infinity proven
RLL cosmology validated
consciousness demonstrated
unlimited computation achieved
```

Likewise, the existence of missing physics does not rescue a statistically disfavored result. Missing physics is a backlog, not positive evidence.

## 7. Next executable route

```text
P0: canonical full-covariance posterior
    = H(z) + DESI full matrix + Pantheon+ STAT+SYS + CMB compressed + growth
    + emcee/dynesty
    + N/tau convergence gate
    + prior-sensitivity matrix
    + manifest(command, environment, inputs, hashes, outputs)

P1: physical closure
    = effective fluid/field/gravity/propagation choice
    + rho_s(a), p_s(a), w_s(a)
    + conservation
    + perturbations/stability
    + LambdaCDM recovery at Omega_s0 -> 0
```

## 8. Retroalimentação

- `F_ok`: symbolic language became typed code, schema, tests, CI and a corrected scientific roadmap.
- `F_gap`: statistical routes remain split and the RLL sector lacks covariant/perturbative closure.
- `F_next`: unify the posterior route before expanding into CLASS/CAMB, CMB spectra or N-body claims.

FIAT LUX — lacuna marcada, execução finita, ciência rastreável.
