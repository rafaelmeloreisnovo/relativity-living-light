# RLL Homeostatic Field Gate — 2026-08-15

Status: `GOVERNED_PROXY_GATE`

Claim boundary: `claim_allowed_physical_gravity=false`

This note adds a controlled RLL projection for the **homeostatic field / buffer** hypothesis discussed in the RAFAELIA/RLL session.

## 1. Working intuition

A persistent field inside a finite boundary, with substrate, time, and dissipation, can reorganize matter/information until the available buffer is filled or stabilized.

Operational images preserved from the session:

- a water jet holding light spheres in a dynamic trap;
- a coral ecosystem reorganizing local planetary material under stellar light;
- a fermentation vessel/kombucha-like buffer expanding only inside its boundary;
- homeostatic buffering: not uncontrolled growth, not static equilibrium, but regulated occupation.

## 2. Defensible technical form

The gate does **not** assert literal biological gravity, literal dark-energy photons, or hardware-scale Planck physics.

It tests a bounded proxy model:

```math
\frac{d\rho_{org}}{dt}
=
\alpha \Phi(t)S(t)
+
\beta C(t)
-
\chi J_{diss}(t)
-
\delta R(t)
+
\eta H(t)
```

Where:

- `rho_org` is reorganized occupation/density proxy;
- `Phi(t)` is field/flux driver;
- `S(t)` is available substrate;
- `C(t)` is confinement/curvature/boundary support;
- `J_diss(t)` is dissipation/outflow;
- `R(t)` is resistance/stress/noise;
- `H(t)` is homeostatic buffering.

The measurable gate residual is:

```math
R_{homeo}
=
\frac{
|\rho_{buffer}-\rho_{org}(t)|
}{
\rho_{buffer}+\varepsilon
}
```

The strong-form proxy target is:

```math
R_{homeo}\to 0
```

Meaning: the proxy occupation approaches a stable buffer target better than a passive baseline.

## 3. Gate criteria

The script `scripts/rll_homeostatic_field_gate.py` reports:

- `FORTE_PROXY_ONLY` if `residual_mean <= 0.10` and `improvement_vs_passive_mean >= 0.15`;
- `NEUTRO_ALTO_PROXY_ONLY` if `residual_mean <= 0.18` and `improvement_vs_passive_mean >= 0.05`;
- `NEUTRO_PROXY_ONLY` if `residual_mean <= 0.30`;
- `FRACO_PROXY_ONLY` otherwise.

Physical/cosmological claims remain blocked until real RLL cosmology/lab data and adversarial baselines pass.

## 4. Local proxy observation from session material

Using the mounted file `RAFAELIA_cosmo_bio_timeseries_10y.csv` as a **proxy-only** input:

```json
{
  "gate": "RLL_HOMEOSTATIC_FIELD_GATE",
  "status": "NEUTRO_ALTO_PROXY_ONLY",
  "claim_allowed_physical_gravity": false,
  "global": {
    "planets": 12,
    "residual_mean": 0.15826107829609484,
    "improvement_vs_passive_mean": 0.6596893924309662,
    "tail_occ_target_corr": 0.0
  }
}
```

Interpretation:

- the passive baseline is beaten in this proxy calculation;
- the residual remains above the `FORTE_PROXY_ONLY` threshold of `0.10`;
- therefore the correct status is `NEUTRO_ALTO_PROXY_ONLY`, not `FORTE`;
- this is evidence of a promising homeostatic-buffer signature, not evidence of new gravity.

## 5. Next gates

To become stronger, this must be repeated against:

1. adversarial shuffled baselines;
2. passive diffusion/saturation baselines;
3. RLL cosmological observables: `H(z)`, `E(a)`, BAO, lensing, `fσ8`;
4. explicit plasma/magnetic terms with degeneracy checks against radiation-like components;
5. documented provenance for each input dataset.

## 6. Invariants

- `metaphor != measurement`
- `proxy != cosmological evidence`
- `fit != causal proof`
- `claim_allowed_physical_gravity=false`
- `TOKEN_VAZIO` is valid where source data or provenance are absent.
